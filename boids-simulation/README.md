# Boids Simulation

## Theme

The **Boids Simulation** is a computational model that simulates the flocking behavior of birds (boids). This project utilizes the p5.js library to visualize the interaction between multiple boids as they move through a defined space.

## Functioning

The Boids algorithm, created by Craig Reynolds in 1986, simulates the flocking behavior of birds using three simple rules:

1. **Separation**: Each boid tries to maintain a certain distance from its neighbors to avoid crowding.
2. **Alignment**: Each boid aligns its direction with the average direction of its neighbors.
3. **Cohesion**: Each boid moves towards the average position of its neighbors to stay within the flock.

These simple rules lead to complex and realistic flocking behavior, resulting in formations that mimic the movement of real birds.

## Source

This project is inspired by Craig Reynolds' original Boids algorithm and the tutorials from [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCodingTrain) by Daniel Shiffman, where the concept of flocking behavior is explored in detail.
